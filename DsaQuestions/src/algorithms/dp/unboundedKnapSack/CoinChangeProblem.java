Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm}
valued coins, how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
Example:
for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4.

approach: this is just the unbounded version solution of subset sum problem.

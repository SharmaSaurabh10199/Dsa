Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers,
the consecutive numbers can be in any order.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
Output:
6
Explanation:
The consecutive numbers here
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6
numbers form the longest consecutive
subsquence.

You are given a bitonic sequence, the task is to find Bitonic Point in it. A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence
of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing.

A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and
after which elements are strictly decreasing. A Bitonic point doesnâ€™t exist if array is only decreasing or only increasing.

Examples :


Input : arr[] = {6, 7, 8, 11, 9, 5, 2, 1}
Output: 11
All elements before 11 are smaller and all
elements after 11 are greater.

Input : arr[] = {-3, -2, 4, 6, 10, 8, 7, 1}
Output: 10
